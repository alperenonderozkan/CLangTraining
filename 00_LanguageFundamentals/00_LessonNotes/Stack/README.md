# Stack

Technical terms in computing are often related to the everyday meanings of the words that they comprise. “Stack” is no exception. Ever heard of a “stack of books”? The easiest way to add a book to a stack of books is to place it on top of the stack. 

The easiest way to remove will be from the top. Thus, the ﬁrst book to be removed from the stack will be thelast book previously placed on the stack. 

Computer scientists refer to this arrangement as “last in, ﬁrst out” (or “ﬁrst in, last out”). Placing an item is called push, and removing an item is called pop.

Stack memory strictly follows ﬁrst in, last out. New data enters the stack memory at the top, and data are always removed from the top. It would be equivalent to add and remove data from the bottom (i.e., it is still ﬁrst in, last out); however, by convention, we use the top instead of the bottom. The concept is the same. Data are pushed onto the top of the stack and, later, popped from the top of the stack.
