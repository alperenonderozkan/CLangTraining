/*
 * A shallow copy in this particular context means that you copy "references" (pointers, whatever) to objects, 
 * and the backing store of these references or pointers is identical, 
 * it's the very same object at the same memory location.
 */

/*
 * A deep copy, in contrast, means that you copy an entire object (struct). 
 * If it has members that can be copied shallow or deep, you also make a deep copy of them.
